# ATM Project in C

This is a simple ATM program made using the C programming language. It allows a user to:

- Check balance  
- Deposit money  
- Withdraw money  
- Change PIN  
- View transaction history  

The program uses text files to save data like balance, PIN, and history.

2. Compile and run the program  
3. Enter the PIN (default PIN is 1234)  
4. Choose options from the menu by typing 1 to 6

## Files Used

- `pin.txt` — stores the PIN  
- `balance.txt` — stores the balance  
- `history.txt` — stores transaction records
